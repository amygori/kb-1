# jQuery

Created by John Resig in 2006. It is the most widely used JavaScript library, although less popular recently.

## jQuery features

* DOM element selections
* DOM manipulation
* Events
* Effects and animations
* Ajax

## Vanilla JavaScript

```js
function updateSection (sectionId, books) {
  const section = id(sectionId)
  const tableBody = section.querySelector('tbody')
  tableBody.innerHTML = booksToHTML(books)
  tableBody.querySelectorAll('.button-delete').forEach(button => {
    button.addEventListener('click', event => {
      const bookId = button.dataset.bookId
      deleteBook(bookId)
    })
  })
}
```

## jQuery

```js
import $ from 'jquery'

function updateSection (sectionId, books) {
  const $tableBody = $(`#${sectionId} tbody`)
  $tableBody.html(booksToHTML(books))
  $tableBody.find('.button-delete').on('click', function () {
    const bookId = $(this).data('bookId')
    deleteBook(bookId)
  })
}
```
