## D2 - in-class lab

You are going to build a todo list app with your team. The app should be a single-page app that lets you add new items, edit current items, delete items, and complete items from a todo list. This should be a single-page app and require no routers. Everything should happen on the same page. An example of the app can be found at [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/). Yours does not have to look quite this good and you don't have to worry about the filters at the bottom for now.

### Step 1 - planning

You will sit down with your team and plan your application using paper. You can make whatever artifacts make sense to you, but you should have at the end of your planning session:

* A list of the components you will use
* For each component:
  * The props it takes
  * The state it holds
  * The methods it has

You will have 30 minutes for planning, with a possible extension of 15 minutes. At the end of planning, you will present your plan.

**NOTE** All computers must be shut during this time period.

### Step 2 - coding

You will code this application with your team. You will have 1 hour to do this.

**NOTE** The only website you should look is at the React documentation. You cannot under any circumstances copy and paste code from other projects. You should not look at old project code during this time.
